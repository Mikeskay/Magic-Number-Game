# Task Title: Magic Number Game.

# Task Description: 

Write a simple Magic Number Game. The computer randomly generates a magic number which is an integer between 1 and
100 (inclusive). The computer asks the player to guess the magic number and tells the
player whether the guess is too big, too small or it is right. Continue asking until the
player enters the magic number.
When the game is over, it should show the player the number of guesses s/he took.
